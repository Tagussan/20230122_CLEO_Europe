This is a sample document format for the one-page extended abstract
for submissions to
\textbf{CLEO\textsuperscript{\textregistered}/Europe-EQEC 2023}.
Although this document is provided in Microsoft Word format, the paper
to be uploaded must be in \textbf{PDF format}. \textbf{Paper size
should be A4 format} (210 mm x 297 mm). \textbf{Margins should be set
for a 2.5 cm top, bottom, left, and right. For text fonts: use only
10pt Times} (roman, \textbf{bold} or \textit{italic}), and Symbol.
Sans Serif Fonts such as Arial can be used in Figures. Include all
equations, drawings, figures and references within the
\textbf{one-page limit}. Avoid asterisks, acknowledgements, job
descriptions or footnotes. \textbf{Do not add page numbers.}

Please be concise in your presentation, highlighting what is novel and
original about your submission. \textbf{Do not repeat the separate 35
word abstract.} Simple equations should be included in-line wherever
possible, whereas more complex expressions should be centred and
numbered if there are several. Figures should be relevant to the
submission and preferably centred as shown below. They should be
placed as close as possible to where they are mentioned in the text.
Placing subfigures side-by-side is a convenient way to include
multiple results within the one-page limit. The figures can be
provided in greyscale or colours. Figure captions should be centred
beneath figures and in an 8-point font. Figure captions should be
indented 1 cm on both sides and justified on both right and left
sides.

\begin{quotation}

%prepage a file figure.png, figure.jpg or figure.pdf to use the following command:
%\includegraphics[width=15cm]{figure}

\noindent\footnotesize\textbf{Fig. 1}
The abbreviation ``Fig.'' (for figure) should appear first, followed
by the figure number, a period, and then the figure caption.
\end{quotation}

References should appear at the end of the article in the order in
which they are referenced in the body of the paper. The font should be
8 point, and the references should be aligned left. A suggested format
for references is given below. Within the main text, references should
be designated by a number in brackets [1], and they should precede a
comma or period [2]. Two references cited at once should be included
together [2,3], separated by a comma, while three or more consecutive
references should be indicated by the bounding numbers and a dash
[1–3].
